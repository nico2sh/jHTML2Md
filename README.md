jHTML2Md
========

A simple converter from HTML to Markdown in Java.

I created this project for importing notes on [Capsa Notes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.runawaybits.capsaandroid.full).

Currently it hasn't any options. I plan to add different markdown styles (Headers using # instead of underline =, for example).

How to use it:
--------------

It's pretty simple, first add [jSoup](http://jsoup.org/) to the classpath. Then:

    String markdownText = HTML2Md.convert(html, baseURL);

Where **html** is a String containing the html code you want to convert, and **baseURL** is the url you will use as a reference for converting relative links.

You can use directly an URL too, like this:

    URL url = new URL("http://www.example.com/");
    HTML2Md.convert(url, 30000);
    
The 30000 is the timeout for requesting the page in milliseconds.

Enjoy!

Roadmap
-------

* Add options for different markdown styles
* Some refactoring, currently the code is quite ugly
